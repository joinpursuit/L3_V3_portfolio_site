# Portfolio Website Project — Week 1

## Overview
Welcome to your first project! In this one-week assignment, you'll create a **personal portfolio website** using only **HTML and CSS**. This project will serve as your personal hub for showcasing your work throughout the program, including your full-stack and mobile apps — as well as any other projects you build outside the curriculum.

This is a low-lift, high-value opportunity to get into the rhythm of:
- Writing clean, semantic code
- Using GitHub properly (commits, branches, PRs)
- Deploying a live website
- Receiving and applying instructor feedback via PRs

---

## Goals
- Build a fully responsive portfolio site with semantic HTML and styled using CSS
- Practice making clean commits and submitting pull requests
- Deploy the website using GitHub Pages or Netlify
- Set the foundation for your technical presence

---

## Requirements
- [x] A `README.md` file that includes your name, a short bio, and a link to the deployed site
- [ ] A responsive layout that works on both mobile and desktop
- [ ] The following sections:
  - **Home** – Welcome message and name
  - **About Me** – Short background, skills, and interests
  - **Projects** – A placeholder or sample project card (you'll add more here throughout the program)
  - **Contact** – Email or form (does not need to be functional)

---

## Suggested File Structure
```
portfolio-site/
├── index.html
├── styles/
│   └── main.css
└── README.md
```

---

## Deployment
- You may deploy using:
  - **GitHub Pages** (recommended for simple site and can link to your profile)
  - **Netlify** (optional but powerful, take into consideration your usecase)

---

## Submission Checklist
- [ ] Add your instructor as a collaborator on your GitHub repo
- [ ] Submit a Pull Request (PR) with your complete code
- [ ] Link to your live site in the PR and `README.md`
- [ ] PR includes multiple commits (not one giant commit)
- [ ] HTML is semantic and passes a basic validator (like https://validator.w3.org/)

---

## Tips
- Use [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) to make it look polished
- Don’t worry about JavaScript — just focus on layout and styling
- Keep your CSS organized (use class naming conventions and grouping)
- You can use tools like [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) or [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) when planning your layout first

## Sample Portfolio Layout Template
You can model your structure after the following:

```
┌───────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Navbar: Home | About | Projects | Contact │
├───────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ [Hero Section]                            │
│ Hi, I'm [Your Name]                       │
│ Aspiring Software Engineer                │
├───────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ About Me                                  │
│ - Background, photo, skills               │
├───────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Projects                                  │
│ - Placeholder card(s)                     │
├───────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Contact                                   │
│ - Email or contact form                   │
└───────────────────────────────────────────┘
```
