# Rosmary Fermin

## Bio 
I am driven by empathy, with a strong focus on fostering community and giving back. In all my previous roles, my primary goal has been to add value to my team and enhance the experience of those I serve. I achieve this by building strong relationships with my team and proactively suggesting and implementing solutions that improve overall team or user experiences.â€‹

My expertise lies in Full Stack software development, with experience in building web applications using JavaScript, TypeScript, Node/Express, React, and Ruby on Rails. I prioritize effective communication and collaboration, meticulous process documentation, thorough unit testing, and consistently improving the codebase.

Before transitioning to software development, I worked in retail-tech, where I earned high customer satisfaction ratings by providing comprehensive solutions for purchasing, troubleshooting, and repairing devices.

My passion for fostering community and giving back drives me to volunteer with local tech and community organizations such as The Marcy Lab School, The New York Tech Talent Pipeline, Hiraldo's Kai Karate School, Inspirationally Grieving My Baby, and New York Cares.
