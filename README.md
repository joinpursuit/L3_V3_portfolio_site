## Short Bio

I am a full-stack developer at Pursuit, interested in creating new technologies to make everyone's life more comfortable. Pursuit is an intensive 12-month software engineering fellowship with a 9% acceptance rate. I started my developer journey in 2016 by learning basic HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Arduino at a summer club. Since that, my passion for technology and programming has been growing exponentially.
